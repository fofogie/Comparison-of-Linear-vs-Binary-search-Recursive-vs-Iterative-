# Comparison-of-Linear-vs-Binary-search-Recursive-vs-Iterative-
This simple program that is made in C++ was made with the reason of comparing the effectiveness of Linear vs Binary search in a dataset. Not only that but each function 
have each respective Recursive and Iterative versions of them making the comparison much more variative and easy to track. 
This simple program is the final project of our Algortihm Complexity Analysis class in this semester. The way we code the program is through both CodeBlocks and VSCode and then we note and run the result with 
R studio to get the graph.
